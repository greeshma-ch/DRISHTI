# PROGRESS.md: Drishti

Handoff log. Read at the start of every session, update before you stop.
Times are IST. Kickoff Oct 26, 9:30 PM. Internal freeze Nov 4, 6:00 PM. Official deadline Nov 5, 7:30 AM.

## Scope (locked unless a trade-off is written below)

**Must:** hazard alerts with direction, navigation to a spoken destination fused with hazards,
emergency flow, personalization (Hindi and English, tone, verbosity, steps), evaluation on recorded clips.
**Stretch (only if core is stable by Nov 1):** "what's nearby" voice query, phone-sensor fall detection.
**Roadmap only:** place recommendations with ambience checks, native Ray-Ban Meta glasses app.

## Pre-kickoff checklist (before Oct 26, 9:30 PM)

- [ ] Meta Model API key works from India (one text call, one image call); latency noted
- [ ] SAM 3.1 tested on one street photo; latency noted
- [ ] Image token count measured for a 640x360 frame (and 512x288); budget numbers recomputed
- [ ] hi-IN TTS voice and Hindi speech-to-text checked on the demo phone
- [ ] Repo created; AGENTS.md and PROGRESS.md committed; `.env.example` added
- [ ] Discord joined; workshop schedule and official rules read
- [ ] Telegram bot created; token saved to `.env`
- [ ] Chest strap or lanyard mount found; 2 filming routes planned

| Oct 30 | P3, P4 | Tier 1 on-device detector, Tier 2 hardening, rate limiter, spend guard | [ ] |
| Oct 31 | P5, P6, P5b | Navigation, emergency flow, profile & onboarding, "what's nearby" | [ ] |
| Nov 1 | P7 | Evaluation harness. Gate: walk outdoors with live alerts; SAM decision | [ ] |

## Credit budget ($150 cap, Meta Model API)

Assumptions to verify on Day 1: Spark about 1,000 input + 120 output tokens per frame call
(about $0.0018); SAM 3.1 about $0.0025 per image; voice transcription about $0.18 per audio hour.

| Line | Plan | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| Dev on recorded clips and cached stills | replay and cache | $8 |
| Live outdoor testing | 6 h cap | $33 |
| Eval runs | about 6 billed runs, rest from cache | $15 |
| Field tests and demo recording | about 4 h | $22 |
| Voice transcription and text calls | | $6 |
| Prompt and SAM exploration | | $10 |
| **Planned total** | | **$94** |
| Reserve (final eval and demo) | | $30 |
| Slack | | $26 |

Throttle levels are defined in AGENTS.md (warn $60, throttle $90, block dev calls above $120).

### Spend log

| Date | Activity | Calls | Est. cost | Running total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Oct 31 | P1 live verification + in-flight benchmark (40 frames) | ~200 | $0.62 | $0.62 |

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Oct 26 | Phone-first on a chest strap or lanyard; glasses-ready design, no native glasses app | No glasses available |
| Oct 26 | Demo languages: Hindi and English | Chosen by builder |
| Oct 26 | Urgent alerts use a fixed phrase table, not free LLM text | Latency, predictability, Hindi grammar control |
| Oct 26 | Tier 2 at about 0.5 fps by default, adaptive up to 1 fps | Credit cap |
| Oct 31 | Output tokens cut to 150; single most urgent hazard returned | Cut Meta latency to median 1.84s (from 2.8s) |
| Oct 31 | Tier 2 max_tokens raised to 450 with retry at 700; never speak "path clear" | Fix safety bug: reasoning tokens hit cutoff causing false "path clear" |
| Oct 31 | Specific hazard phrase table restored without free-text generation | 18 hazard types, clear_side avoidance action, label for other, <= 4 words |

## Current session

- Working on: Specific spoken hazards without free-text generation (expanded enums, clear_side, label for other, phrase tables)
- Done this session:
  - `server/phrases.py` & `apps/web/src/phrases.ts`:
    - Fixed phrase table and deterministic phrase builder for hi and en.
    - 18 hazard types: chair, table, bench, door, wall, pole, tree_branch, vehicle, rickshaw, bicycle, person, animal, stairs, step_down, pothole, open_drain, construction, other.
    - Direction + avoid action from `clear_side` (left/right/none), <= 4 words (e.g. chair center, clear_side right -> "कुर्सी आगे, दाएँ हटें" / "Chair ahead, step right").
    - "other" with label speaks "{label} आगे" / "{label} ahead"; falls back to generic "खतरा" / "Hazard" only when label missing.
    - Hard Rule 1 enforced: returns `""` when no hazard; never speaks "path clear".
  - `server/meta_client.py`:
    - `Hazard` schema updated with `clear_side: "left"|"right"|"none"` and `label` (max 2 words if other).
    - `SYSTEM_PROMPT` updated with expanded enums without free-text generation.
  - `apps/web/src/App.tsx`:
    - Updated `HazardItem` interface; imports `buildPhrase` from `phrases.ts`.
  - `server/tests/test_frame.py` (24 passing tests) & `apps/web/src/App.test.tsx` (6 passing tests):
    - Verified chair center specific phrases with and without clear_side in hi and en.
    - Verified "other" with label, "other" without label, and never "path clear".
- Next: P2 Priority arbiter and queuing
- Blockers: None

## Open issues and risks

- Meta API reachability from India (fallback: OpenRouter for Spark; open-weights SAM via Modal or Baseten)
- SAM latency (fallback: every 3rd to 5th keyframe, or Spark-only Tier 2)
- Hindi voice or speech recognition quality (fallback: alternate voice, cloud TTS, or Hindi captions)
- 0.5 fps Tier 2 means static hazards may be reported late; report distance-to-hazard at alert time in the eval
- False alarms (fallback: higher thresholds, two-frame agreement; report the trade-off honestly)
